## EEB 2245

Each half of the course counts for 50% of your lecture grade.
Your grade in the course will be based on your performance on four
lecture exams (each worth 100 points); however, your lowest exam grade
will be dropped, so the total is 300 points. 
*Please note*: because you are allowed to drop one of these grades, *we will not give make-up exams*.

## EEB 2245W

For W students your final grade in the lecture portion of the course will be 
calculated as above. This grade will constitute 75% of your final course grade. 
The W portion of the course, as determined by your “W” instructor, will constitute the 
remaining 25% of your final course grade. Please note that **an F in either the W or 
lecture portion of the course will result in an F for the entire course**. 


Dr. Louise Lewis (PBB 200; tel: 486–6723; [louise.lewis@uconn.edu](mailto:louise.lewis@uconn.edu)) is the coordinator 
of the W portion of the course. Refer to HuskyCT for further information on the 
W portion of the course. You will be assigned your W instructor at the mandatory 
library session you attend for the W portion of the course. You must sign up for a 
library session in HuskyCT.
